### Download Bootstrap using NPM
___

Well, I think all of you use GitHub to keep under control your code.

**Do you really wnat to host Bootstrap files within your repository?**

If you do that you probably know that:

* you are duplicating code that is available on-line
* your local copy will quikly become outdate
* you need to to manually update it

For me this short list it's enough to decide to never dowload a library ever again in life! 

Tools like **Bower** or **NPM** help us to dowload libraries on our behalf and keep those libraries up to date.

In the the DEMO 005 you can see how I used NPM.
