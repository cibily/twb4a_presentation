### Use variables to customize your project
___
Some developer made customization direcly into bootstrap.css file.

In my prospective i thinki that:

* it's a waste of time 
* when you want update to a new version you will lose you customizations

**On the variable.css file you can find what you need and import it on you custom.css file**

Remenber to define your own value **BEFORE** to import variable.css file and ypur stile will be applied.
